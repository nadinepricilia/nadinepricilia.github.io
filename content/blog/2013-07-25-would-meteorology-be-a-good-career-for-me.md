+++
<p>Here are some questions you may want to ask yourself if you are considering a career in meteorology:</p>
<ol>
<li>Am I curious about the world around me and why it is the way it is?</li>
<li>Would I like to work in a field of science that has many important applications in human affairs?</li>
<li>Am I challenged by the idea of applying basic scientific principles to understand the behavior of the atmosphere?</li>
<li>Am I intrigued by the concept of using mathematics as a language to describe things that happen in the world around me?</li>
<li>Do I enjoy science and math courses?</li>
<li>Would I like to work with supercomputers, satellites and other sophisticated research tools?</li>
<li>Am I open to change?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are no right or wrong answers, but all of these questions are closely related to the nature of modern meteorology and the challenges of our changing atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the past, not many women or members of ethnic minority groups have gone into careers in meteorology or other branches of the physical sciences. Today, many rewarding career opportunities are open to anyone who has a good knowledge of meteorology and the ability to use it in atmospheric research or applied meteorology. In meteorology, as in many other professions, employers are actively recruiting women and minorities.</p>
