Why are you so strange?
Enduring deep agony and nobody understands
Your thoughts are buried
Quietly
No one asks

You try to whisper hint
But it's too soft
It cannot even scratch

You try to remain stiff
Stiff but tender
You don't know
If you are sure
Or just afraid
You just be

Stand still
Sink in melancholy

Are they even notice
You?
