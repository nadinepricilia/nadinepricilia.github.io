Perhaps in some points of view, I was crazy. I wasn't even in love with him back then when he asked my father and me. I didn't even feel butterflies. Instead, I was ill afterwards. I couldn't trust anyone for that kind of decision. Not even myself. But, Allah. So my parents and I asked to the One and Only. So then I did my part of crazy. By saying yes. To a man from a land which I had never heard the name before. To a man I barely knew. (at Nederlands Openluchtmuseum)
